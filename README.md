Checklist
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is just a template, so a few things should be changed to make
good use of this template. You can use the checklist below to
ensure that you get the most out of it. We recommend that you
perform at least the first two steps, everything else is up to
you.

1. [ ] **Rename the filter**: rename the filter `greetings.lua` to
   your chosen name. It's often a good idea to make the filter
   name match the repository name: if your repository is named
   `lorem`, then the filter should be named `lorem.lua`.

2. [ ] **Update the license**: The template is published under the
   MIT, and we recommend to keep the same license for your code.
   You should update the LICENSE file so it has your name.

3. [ ] **Update this README**: describe your filter, so people
   will know what to expect. You may also want to update the URLs
   above to match your repository.
